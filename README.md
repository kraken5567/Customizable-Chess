# Customizable-Chess
My Customizable Chess Game (Python)



# Things That work (properly) right now:

Save Related: Creation of a (single) save, reading saves

Piece related: knights, rooks, king



# Things to be Tweaked 

renderer (super inefficient and causes flikering)

board implementation (rendered everyframe instead of once)

options (txt -> Json)

starting the game has to be done in terminal (bad)

board doesn't use all of the screen/lacks any sort of UI or anything in blank area
